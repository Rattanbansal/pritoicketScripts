From the 2nd till the 11th of July Cirque Éloize, Gravity & Other Myths, Circa and FLIP Fabrique will perform matinee shows as well as evening performances. The shows are characterized by their unique and energetic style of mind-blowing acrobatics, that test the limits of the human body and even surpass them. The performers communicate through explosive body language that will bring audiences of all ages to the edge of their seat. 

This young and new movement of performance art originates from traditional circus acts. A new generation of performers, growing up in cities with hip-hop, and breakdance around them, bring a new urban perspective to traditional circus. Generally, the acts are part of an overall theme, supported by music and light arrangements and often also additional forms of performance art varying from classical dance to beatboxing. In France, the United Kingdom, United States and Australia, this new movement is already more established and well-known.

The current auction building was built in 1912, and functioned as a commercial sail through auction until december 1973. A lot of the produce sold at the auction came from the islands of the nearby Realm of a Thousand Islands, once consisting of more than 15.000 islands, many of which were used to grow vegetables. After closing for commercial auctions, the buidling and bordering boat halls were carefully restored and function as a museum on a unique piece of Dutch history.

Your day begins with a relaxing panoramic drive through the City of Westminster with your expert Blue Badge Tour Guide. Along the way, your guide will regale you with interesting stories and facts about London's long history. On this scenic journey through the city, you will see all of London's most iconic sights, including Westminster Abbey, the iconic Elizabeth Tower, also known as 'Big Ben' and much, much more!

Changing of the Guard Ceremony
At Buckingham Palace, we will stop to watch a ceremony that is the epitome of the pomp and pageantry for which Britain is famous for around the world. Elite soldiers from the British military, also known as the Household Division, have been dutifully guarding the monarch since 1660.

During the ceremony, immaculately turned out guards from the New Guard arrive to assume responsibility for protecting Buckingham Palace. Accompanied by a regimental marching band, the soldiers of the Household Division are instantly recognisable in their bearskin caps and scarlet tunics.

The City of London

After a break for lunch your tour continues. With its origins in the fortified Roman settlement of Londonium, the City of London is the ceremonial and historic centre of the capital as well as the financial centre housing both the Stock Exchange and The Bank of England. Your afternoon tour takes you on a wonderful eclectic journey through the historic and the modern highlighting London’s diversity and rich culture.

St Paul's Cathedral

The first stop on our tour is an iconic symbol of London. Sir Christopher Wren's masterpiece took 35 years to build and today is one of the largest churches in the world. Incredibly, this towering domed cathedral was also the tallest building in London until the 1960s.

Its construction between 1675-1710 was part of a rebuilding programme after the original cathedral located here was swept away in the Great Fire of London in 1666: With no fewer than seven chapels, countless statues and priceless art, as well as Europe's largest crypt, there are historical and religious treasures around every corner at St Paul's.

Explore the history of the cathedral with your expert Guide who will bring its fascinating events to life.

The Tower of London

Explore almost 1,000 years of history that began with the construction of a fortress and royal residence by William The Conqueror. The long history of 'The Tower' is one of imprisonment, murder and execution. The last person executed here was in 1941, and over the years spies, criminals and even queens have met their bloody end by the executioner's hand at the tower.

","Panoramic Tour\n\nYour day begins with a relaxing panoramic drive through the City of Westminster with your expert Blue Badge Tour Guide. Along the way, your guide will regale you with interesting stories and facts about London's long history. On this scenic journey through the city, you will see all of London's most iconic sights, including Westminster Abbey, the iconic Elizabeth Tower, also known as 'Big Ben' and much, much more!\n\nChanging of the Guard Ceremony\nAt Buckingham Palace, we will stop to watch a ceremony that is the epitome of the pomp and pageantry for which Britain is famous for around the world. Elite soldiers from the British military, also known as the Household Division, have been dutifully guarding the monarch since 1660.\n\nDuring the ceremony, immaculately turned out guards from the New Guard arrive to assume responsibility for protecting Buckingham Palace. Accompanied by a regimental marching band, the soldiers of the Household Division are instantly recognisable in their bearskin caps and scarlet tunics.\n\nThe City of London\n\nAfter a break for lunch your tour continues. With its origins in the fortified Roman settlement of Londonium, the City of London is the ceremonial and historic centre of the capital as well as the financial centre housing both the Stock Exchange and The Bank of England. Your afternoon tour takes you on a wonderful eclectic journey through the historic and the modern highlighting London’s diversity and rich culture.\n\nSt Paul's Cathedral\n\nThe first stop on our tour is an iconic symbol of London. Sir Christopher Wren's masterpiece took 35 years to build and today is one of the largest churches in the world. Incredibly, this towering domed cathedral was also the tallest building in London until the 1960s.\n\nIts construction between 1675-1710 was part of a rebuilding programme after the original cathedral located here was swept away in the Great Fire of London in 1666: With no fewer than seven chapels, countless statues and priceless art, as well as Europe's largest crypt, there are historical and religious treasures around every corner at St Paul's.\n\nExplore the history of the cathedral with your expert Guide who will bring its fascinating events to life.\n\nThe Tower of London\n\nExplore almost 1,000 years of history that began with the construction of a fortress and royal residence by William The Conqueror. The long history of 'The Tower' is one of imprisonment, murder and execution. The last person executed here was in 1941, and over the years spies, criminals and even queens have met their bloody end by the executioner's hand at the tower.\n\nThe Tower of London is also home to the priceless Crown Jewels Collection. This glittering display of gems and gold includes the Star of Africa, the world's largest cut diamond, as well as a collection of crowns, robes, and other items of ceremonial regalia. It would be improper to fail to mention the tower ravens. Legend has it that at least half a dozen must stay within the bounds of the tower or the monarchy will fall.\n\n\nOperates\nDaily (except 24-26 December & 01 January)\n",2024-12-17 09:57:30

Who built Stonehenge? Why was it built? Discover the answer to these questions and learn how it was constructed using rudimental tools and stone from quarries hundreds of miles away. In the world-class exhibition centre, you’ll get the chance to come face-to-face with a 5,500-year-old man and over 250 ancient objects.

Bath

Our second stop will be a scenic tour of the historic city of Bath, originally built as a place of well-being and relaxation by the Romans over 2,000 years ago. Home to the country’s only natural thermal hot springs, Bath is a delightful city where the ancient world is intertwined with threads of medieval and more recent Georgian history. Our scenic tour of Bath provides an excellent introduction to the major sights of this beautiful city, including Pulteney Bridge, The Assembly Rooms and Bath Abbey.

Afterwards, you will visit the famous Roman Baths, home to Britain’s only natural thermal hot springs. The Roman Baths themselves are below the modern street level. There are four main features: the Sacred Spring, the Roman Temple, the Roman Bath House and the museum, holding finds from Roman Bath. The buildings above street level date from the 19th century.

Miyajima
A World Heritage site. Established in the 6th century, this shrine is one of Japan's finest and is famous for its beautiful Shinden-zukuri style structure (architecture representative of a nobles' residence in the Heian period). The contrast of the green of Mount Misen behind the lacquered shrine pavilion and the blue of the Seto Sea is beautiful and evocative of the underwater palace of Ryugujo.

Take the bus to Peace Memorial Park

Peace Memorial Park
This large-scale park was established in 1949 after the Pacific War ended, and is visited by countless visitors as a symbol of peace. The museum within the park is an Important Cultural Property of Japan and was built to remind future generations of the terror wrought by atomic bombs.

The Atomic Bomb Dome is a symbol of the disastrous atomic bombing during WWII, the first atomic bombs used in human history, and has been preserved as it was to promote peace and elimination of atomic weapons around the world.

Meadows, Cows, Ditches, and Windmills will take you to the world-famous Afsluitdijk. This dike, connecting the 2 northern provinces and protecting half of the country against the force of the North Sea is the gateway to the Amsterdam Lake District. here you will discover the Netherlands beyond the busy city of Amsterdam.

Time to explore the dike. Walk across to the North Sea, climb the monument; a watchtower to look out over both the Ijssel lake and the North sea, or take a picture with Mr. Lelie, founder of the dike.

Next, we enter the Amsterdam Lake District in the province of Friesland. Where we step back in time in the only open-air museum village in the area. Get your camera ready because you want to capture this. Meet the villagers, have our local guide take you back in time to the craftsman, inside an old farmhouse, walk through the grasslands and take a picture with the cows in the meadows.

Next, we will visit Hindeloopen. A beautiful, authentic city with only 900 inhabitants. Our local guide will await you and take you through the streets and alleys of this wonderful little city. Visit the painting shop of Mr. Roosje. The only painter in the city which still paints according to the typical Hindelooper style.

Next, it’s time for some free time. Wander through the streets, buy local souvenirs or have a drink in the harbor.

Our final stop will be at the beautiful Ir. D.F. Woudagemaal. A steam pumping station at the border of the Amsterdam Lake District. Where a local operator will give you entrance to the heart of this Steam Cathedral. It is not without reason that this beautiful and indispensable building has been a UNESCO World Monument for several years.

By the end of the afternoon, it’s time to head back to Amsterdam, where you will enjoy your evening in the city thinking about the beauty of the Netherlands beyond Amsterdam.","Within 15 minutes we have left the busy city center of Amsterdam behind us and we will start to discover the Netherlands beyond Amsterdam.\n\nMeadows, Cows, Ditches, and Windmills will take you to the world-famous Afsluitdijk.

On this 3+hour tour we'll stroll through Amsterdam hitting all my favorite and best locations to get traditional Dutch snacks and drinks. There will be 8 stops in total - mostly food but also a stop over to the best bar for top-quality Dutch beer. Price is €60/person through September 2017

A very common question is: ""what is Dutch Food?"" The simple answer: they eat a bit of sweet, a bit of salty and, of course, anything deep fried served with beer. We are going to explore some of the more and less well-known Dutch foods, snacks and drinks.

Sweet - The City that gave us the tastiest cheese also gave us the best Dutch snack - Stroopwafel. The pre-packaged ones you buy at the store are a great way to make your friends smile back home but nothing beats a fresh one made the moment you order it.

Salty - 800 hundred years ago we were a simple trading village and two of the biggest items we traded were hemp and Haring. Hemp is more commonly smoked in Amsterdam today but Haring is served as it has been for centuries. It might not be your thing, but it doesn't get more traditionally Dutch and it's worth a try.

Beer - Many counties have that beer which is globally known but not often drunk at home. Not true of Heineken the Dutch really love it and will happily order one in a bar. That being said, it is your typical mass produced lager. In the last 10 years craft beers and small breweries have blown up in the Netherlands and many are in Amsterdam. We'll stop by Amsterdam’s greatest bar to sample a few of the best on tap.

Come hungry leave satisfied.

And when we are finished you'll be able to complete the follow sentence:
""It's as Dutch as _____ ___!""

Today it is a public park and it belongs to the city's heritage. It has been declared UNESCO’s World Heritage site and is just another marvel that awaits you on your visit to Barcelona.
When you go to Park Güell, you should enter by the big staircase dominated by the dragon decorated with a mosaic of ceramic tiles, the Catalan style known as “trencadís”. This dragon is one of the most characteristic images of Barcelona. Originally written Park Güell (using the English spelling), the park is arranged around a large central square bordered by a snaking, “trencadís”-covered bench. Below the square, the roof is supported by 86 Doric columns, like trees, with paths between them, and viaducts on sloping columns: Gaudí's work, like no other, unites nature and architecture.

We will take the motorway and about 10:15 am we are going to arrive in Calella de Palafrugell, a small fisherman’s village that still retains today the traditional appearance of the past. 
About 11:15 am, we will start walking along Camino de Ronda, which is going to lead us to the neighbouring town of Llafranc. We will hike about 30 minutes easy terrain for everyone.
Llafranc is also a small, elegant and captivating seaside town, with all the delightfulness of the towns on this coast.
About 12:00 we will travel to Pals, a town located inland and on the top of a hill. The village is built entirely in an integrated medieval site. At the top, there is a cylindrical tower from the XII century. It has an excellent terrace that offers stunning views of the Costa Brava and surroundings.
Walking through the cobbled streets you will feel like you have gone back in time. 
Our next visit is to l’Estartit, seaside village with an important port famous worldwide as being an important diving centre because the Medes Islands archipelago lies only one kilometre from the coast.
Medes islands are of great interest for the wide variety of flora and fauna that inhabit the whole marine area, with more than 1200 species classified.

At about 12:00 pm we will get to the emblematic village of Tossa de Mar, considered “the pearl of Costa Brava” because in this small area we can find all those landscapes and historic elements which have given it such well-deserved fame.
Its spectacular sceneries, from its shores, beaches, caves in the cliffs to its lush vegetation, turn it into one of the locations that have better preserved its natural environment in perfect harmony with the tourism industry.
Outside its walls, we can find the traditional fishing neighbourhood, known as Sa Roqueta, which still maintains the sailor atmosphere of these typical villages on Costa Brava.Once we arrive in Tossa de Mar, we will begin a walking tour of the beach, following the fortified perimeter up to the lighthouse on the top, for those who are interested. Over there, you will appreciate stunning views of the coastline. When descending, we will go through the narrow streets and stone houses of Vila Vella until we get to the fishing district. From there on, you will have free time to have lunch. This village has the greatest gastronomic offer from all Costa Brava.","On this tour, we are going to visit the Girona coast, named 100 years ago as the Costa Brava.  \nWe will take the motorway and after 1h15m we will be at Lloret de Mar, the main touristic village of Costa Brava. We will have about an hour to explore this colourful and dynamic village with a strong personality.\nAlong its unique beach promenade, we will be able to enjoy great views of its beaches, arising from the majestic beach of Lloret to the hidden Sa Caleta. In addition, two small hills on both edges of the beach promenade are privileged to viewpoints throughout the site and surroundings.\nIn the middle of its most famous shopping street we will also be able to admire architectural jewels of great value such as Saint Roma church, with an exquisite modernism style, and inside the church, a 16th-century altarpiece which is still so well preserved.\nAt approximately 10:50 am we will go on board DOFIJETS, which will lead us to the neighbouring village of Tossa de Mar.

mec_id,4130,longDesc,"Thanks to an audio guide*, a map and an informative booklet, you can discover on your own all the most important facets of the monastery's history, not to mention the major sites of the Sanctuary of Montserrat. The four suggested routes will take us to the Basilica, the Santa Cova, the Trail of the Degotalls and the Via Crucis.

The new, completely renovated Montserrat audiovisual space is the result of the monastery's desire to provide more information to the thousands of pilgrims and visitors who want to know what Montserrat is and what it means.

Huis Van Meerten is een negentiende-eeuws huis met een zeventiende-eeuwse uitstraling. Overal in het interieur zijn prachtige bouwfragmenten verwerkt: consoles, houtsnijwerk, bedsteden, tegeltableaus en schouwen. Achter de imponerende natuurstenen voorgevel ontvouwt zich een klassiek ‘Oudhollands’ interieur met hypermoderne voorzieningen zoals vloerverwarming, gaslicht en elektriciteit. 
Een bezoek aan Huis van Meerten aan de Oude Delft 199 voelt als een bezoek aan Lambert en zijn zus Dina. Neem dus gerust even plaats achter Lamberts bureau en gluur in zijn geheime kluis. Of drink een kop thee in Dina’s gezellige kamer, en voeg een paar steekjes toe aan haar borduurwerk. Kom langs en voel je vooral thuis.
Huis Van Meerten van Hendrick de Keyser is geopend op woensdag van 13-17 uur, en op vrijdag t/m zondag 11-17 uur. Voor het reserveren van tickets, adres en prijzen kijk je op www.museumhuizen.nl/huis-van-meerten

Neem dus gerust even plaats achter Lamberts bureau en gluur in zijn geheime kluis. Of drink een kop thee in Dina’s gezellige kamer, en voeg een paar steekjes toe aan haar borduurwerk. Kom langs en voel je vooral thuis.\nHuis Van Meerten van Hendrick de Keyser is geopend op woensdag van 13-17 uur, en op vrijdag t/m zondag 11-17 uur. Voor het reserveren van tickets, adres en prijzen kijk je op www.museumhuizen.nl/huis-van-meerten\n",2024-12-17 08:52:23

Can I control the sleds myself?
Yes, each sled is individually controlled by the rider. A motor is pulling each sled all the way to the top of our mountain. When you reach the top, the rider is in control of the speed going down the mountain. You control the speed by pushing forward 2 handlebars mounted to your left and right of each sled. Pushing it all the way forward will release the brakes and allow you to go full speed. By slightly pulling the handles back you can reduce the speed. Rider’s are not allowed to come to a complete stop or go too slow.

What are the age requirements?
To be able to ride the coaster as a passenger, you have to be at least 3 years old (and 38” tall). The person driving the cart has to be at least 16 years old to ride with a passenger (or 56” tall to ride alone. There is no age requirement to ride alone as long as the height requirement is met.)

Can 2 people ride together in one sled?
Yes, 2 people can ride together as long as the driver is at least 16 years of age to be responsible for a passenger. The passenger has to be at least 3 years old and 38 inches tall. The maximum weight limit can not exceed 375 pounds in dry conditions and 330 pounds in wet conditions.

mec_id,71713,longDesc,"Bath
Enjoy a scenic tour of the historic city of Bath, originally built as a place of well-being and relaxation by the Romans over 2,000 years ago. Home to the country’s only natural thermal hot springs, Bath is a delightful city where the ancient world is intertwined with threads of medieval and more recent Georgian history. Our scenic tour of Bath provides an excellent introduction to the major sights of this beautiful city, including Pulteney Bridge, The Assembly Rooms and Bath Abbey.

Afterwards, you will visit the famous Roman Baths, home to Britain’s only natural thermal hot springs. The Roman Baths themselves are below the modern street level. There are four main features: the Sacred Spring, the Roman Temple, the Roman Bath House and the museum, holding finds from Roman Bath. The buildings above street level date from the 19th century.
Choose one of the following villages to add to your Bath Tour

Option 1 - Lacock

Lacock, just four miles south of Chippenham, is probably the most beautifully preserved village in the Cotswolds. Meander along this quintessential English village where little has changed in 200 years with streets lined with timber-framed houses and independent shops.   Lookout for the 14th-century tithe barn in Lacock village once used by the nuns of Lacock to store grain. Built with blocks of limestone rubble supporting a cruck-framed roof.

Lacock village is widely used in medieval and fantasy dramas such as Harry Potter, film and television productions such as Downton Abbey. These Wiltshire village’s timber-framed houses provide that authentic street scene. 

Option 2 - Castle Combe village, Cotswolds

One of the many pretty villages in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Castle Combe offers plenty of picturesque walks and charming streets waiting to be explored!  Taking it’s name from the 12th century castle which stood about 500m to the north, the word combe is an old English word for a short valley or hollow on a hillside or coastline.  Hardly changing in 500 years this is your typical chocolate box village.

The village has a rich history and the houses are made up of the typical honey coloured Cotswold stone.  Dating back to 13th century you will find a Market Cross and St Andrew’s Church within this village. Spot the faceless clock which is believed to be one of the oldest working clocks in the country. 
Castle Combe has also featured regularly as a film location, for The Wolf Man, Stardust and Stephen Spielberg’s War Horse. It was also used in the original Dr Doolittle film. 
Wander along the village to the bridge and enjoy the beautiful views!

mec_id,71715,longDesc,"Leeds Castle

Depart London and head down into the Kent countryside to the first stop, Leeds Castle.

Often referred to as 'The Loveliest Castle in The World', Leeds Castle has played many roles in its nearly 900-year history. From a Norman stronghold to a magnificent royal palace, the castle today has been converted by subsequent owners into an idyllic countryside retreat.

With 500 acres of parkland and landscaped gardens to explore, it's easy to see why this beautiful castle has been the private property of no fewer than six English queens.

The Princess Alexandra Gardens alongside the River Len are a carpet of Daffodils, Narcissi and Anemones presenting a vibrant burst of colour. Later in the year, guests are treated to the splendour of Azaleas and Rhododendrons.


Canterbury Cathedral

Pilgrims and visitors have made their way to Canterbury Cathedral since the Middle Ages. It remains one of the most visited places in the country, and, just as importantly, a working, living church and community.

Founded by St Augustine in 600 AD, the Cathedral today is one of the most excellent examples of Gothic architecture in England. The stunning structure welcomes visitors all year round, who come to gaze at the remarkable architecture and visit the very spot where Archbishop Thomas Becket was murdered in 1170.

The Martyrdom at Canterbury Cathedral
Canterbury’s role as one of Europe’s most important pilgrimage centres is inextricably linked to the murder of its most famous Archbishop, Thomas Becket, in 1170. When after a long-lasting dispute, King Henry II is said to have exclaimed ‘Who will rid me of this low born priest?’, four knights set off for Canterbury and murdered Thomas here in the place we now call the Martyrdom.

The Miracle Windows (Trinity Chapel) show some of the miracles that were said to have taken place after the murder of Thomas Becket. Many of the pilgrims visiting the tomb of St Thomas would not have been able to read and write and stained-glass windows were meant to exclaim the glory of God as well as educate and ‘entertain’ pilgrims.


The White Cliffs of Dover

There can be no doubt that the White Cliffs of Dover are one of this country's most spectacular natural features. They are an official icon of Britain and have been a sign of hope and freedom for centuries.

We will stop briefly for photos to marvel at the beauty and special appeal of this chalk grassland next to the English Channel.

You will have the opportunity to learn more about the fascinating military and penal history of the White Cliffs from your expert Guide.","Leeds Castle\n\nDepart London and head down into the Kent countryside to the first stop, Leeds Castle.\n\nOften referred to as 'The Loveliest Castle in The World', Leeds Castle has played many roles in its nearly 900-year history.

mec_id,78059,longDesc,"Join us to learn about part of the impressive British culture and history on this tour that takes you to two of the most famous places in the United Kingdom: the imposing stones of Stonehenge and the Roman Baths of Bath.

For this excursion, we will meet you at the agreed meeting point and once everyone is together, we will board a bus that will take us to our destinations.

First, we will head to the beautiful city of Bath, where the famous and ancient Roman Baths are located. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the baths, also known as the Thermae of Bath, date back to 40 AD and were built after the Roman conquest of Britain.

There you can admire the architectural details that have surprisingly been very well preserved to date, in addition to walking around the thermal springs and even tasting a sip of the waters in the Pump Room.

You will not only enjoy the visit to the baths, but also a leisurely tour of the city. You will stroll through its lovely streets and see Pulteney Bridge. Get your camera ready and your best poses, because you will certainly want to take amazing photos.

Then, we will head north to Salisbury, home of the famous megalithic monument of Stonehenge.

These stones have stood for 5,000 years and are surrounded by thousands of theories: Were they a religious temple or a Bronze Age cemetery? Are they an astronomical clock?

It is believed that they allowed the ancestors of the area to predict celestial events, such as eclipses, solstices, and the equinox, very much like an astronomical observatory today.

Prepare your camera to take all the pictures you want while aboard.

We will start the day heading to St. Paul's Cathedral, famous for its imposing dome which conceals a series of tombs, monuments, and intricately painted mosaics.

You will surely be amazed by Sir Christopher Wren's masterpiece and the place where the wedding of Princess Diana and Charles took place.

After visiting the impressive Cathedral, we will head to Buckingham Palace to see the changing of the guard.

We cannot guarantee that the King will be home, so be sure to look for the flag! But, even if he is not home and cannot invite you for a cup of tea, a stop to take photos outside the palace is still a great experience.

You will also be able to see how the Royal Guard marches towards the palace accompanied by a military band during the traditional changing of the guard ceremony.

After visiting the beautiful and imposing palace, we will leave solid ground and board the iconic London Eye, ascending to 135 meters to marvel at the spectacular views of the capital.

Once we come down from the heights, we won’t go to the water just yet! The River Thames awaits you for a pleasant and relaxing boat ride.

The adventure is not over yet!

Once you disembark, you will visit the Tower of London, officially called Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress, recently remodeled and ready to share its most fascinating and mysterious secrets with you.

Be amazed by the shining crown jewels and be cautious of the ghost of Anne Boleyn that haunts near where she was beheaded.

Learn about the history of the Yeoman Warders, who have been protecting the Tower of London since the Tudor era, and each new recruit takes a royal loyalty oath that is said to date back to 1337.

The best part of this experience is that, in addition to having an expert guide who will provide you with the best and most interesting information about the history and culture of London, you will also enjoy a handy little snack.

Para esta increíble experiencia, nos reuniremos contigo en el punto de encuentro acordado y, una vez todo juntos, abordaremos un cómodo autobús que nos trasladará a los puntos de interés y te permitirá gozar de un recorrido panorámico. 

Prepara tu cámara para tomar todas las fotografías que quieras estando a bordo. 

Iniciaremos el día tomando rumbo a la Catedral de San Pablo, famosa por su imponente cúpula que oculta una serie de tumbas, monumentos y mosaicos pintados con gran detalle. 

Seguramente te maravillarás con la obra maestra de Sir Christopher Wren y el lugar donde se celebró la boda de la princesa Diana y Carlos.

Luego de conocer la impresionante Catedral, nos dirigiremos al Palacio de  Buckingham para ver el cambio de guardia. 

No podemos garantizar que el Rey se encuentre en casa, ¡asegúrate de buscar la bandera! Pero, aunque no se encuentre y no pueda invitarte una taza de té, una parada para tomar fotografías en el exterior del palacio sigue siendo una gran experiencia.

También podrás observar cómo la Guardia Real marcha hacia el palacio acompañada de una banda militar durante la tradicional ceremonia de cambio de guardia. 

Una vez hayas presenciado la bella ceremonia, visitarás la Torre de Londres, oficialmente llamada Palacio Real y Fortaleza de su Majestad, recientemente remodelada y lista para contarte sus secretos más fascinantes y misteriosos. 

Sorpréndete con las relucientes joyas de la corona y ten cuidado con el fantasma de Ana Bolena que acecha cerca de donde fue decapitada. 

Conoce, también, la historia de Los Yeoman Warders, que han estado protegiendo la Torre de Londres desde la época de los Tudor, y cada nuevo recluta realiza un juramento de lealtad real que se dice que data de 1337.

¡Pero eso no es todo! Ya que este increíble tour, también te incluye un tranquilo recorrido por el Río Támesis. 

Lo mejor de toda esta experiencia es que, además de contar con un guía experto que te proporcionará la mejor y más interesante información de la historia y cultura de Londres, también podrás disfrutar de un práctico y pequeño refrigerio.

Para esta increíble experiencia, nos reuniremos contigo en el punto de encuentro acordado y, una vez todo juntos, abordaremos un cómodo autobús que nos trasladará a los puntos de interés y te permitirá gozar de un recorrido panorámico. 

Prepara tu cámara para tomar todas las fotografías que quieras estando a bordo. 

Iniciaremos el día tomando rumbo a la Catedral de San Pablo, famosa por su imponente cúpula que oculta una serie de tumbas, monumentos y mosaicos pintados con gran detalle. 

Seguramente te maravillarás con la obra maestra de Sir Christopher Wren y el lugar donde se celebró la boda de la princesa Diana y Carlos.

Luego de conocer la impresionante Catedral, nos dirigiremos al Palacio de  Buckingham para ver el cambio de guardia. 

No podemos garantizar que el Rey se encuentre en casa, ¡asegúrate de buscar la bandera! Pero, aunque no se encuentre y no pueda invitarte una taza de té, una parada para tomar fotografías en el exterior del palacio sigue siendo una gran experiencia.

También podrás observar cómo la Guardia Real marcha hacia el palacio acompañada de una banda militar durante la tradicional ceremonia de cambio de guardia. 

Luego de haber presenciado la espectacular ceremonia, la aventura continúa con un tranquilo recorrido en barco por las bellas aguas del Río Támesis. 

Lo mejor de toda esta experiencia es que, además de contar con un guía experto que te proporcionará la mejor y más interesante información de la historia y cultura de Londres, también podrás disfrutar de un práctico y pequeño refrigerio.

For this excursion, we will meet you at the agreed meeting point, and once everyone is together, we will board a bus that will take us to our destinations.

First, we will visit Windsor Castle, a structure dating back to the 11th century, and currently one of the oldest and largest occupied castles in the world.

You will be dazzled by the beautiful State Apartments, which, in addition to being luxuriously decorated, feature many works of art by famous painters such as Rubens, Van Dyck, and Holbein. You will also have the chance to visit the lovely St. George's Chapel, which served as the venue for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

After marveling at the size and beautiful gardens of the palace, we will head to Stonehenge to try to uncover the mysterious origin of the megalithic monument located there.

These stones have stood for 5,000 years on the Salisbury plains and are surrounded by thousands of theories: Were they a religious temple or a Bronze Age cemetery? Are they an astronomical clock?

After learning about the impressive stones, their theories, and the 250 archaeological treasures discovered in the area, we will go to visit the beautiful Salisbury Cathedral.

This building is over 800 years old and has a height of 123 meters. It features an impressive spire that is regarded as one of the masterpieces of early architecture.

There, you will be able to see the modern baptismal font designed by William Pye, the oldest working mechanical clock in the world, and the Magna Carta, protected by UNESCO as a significant historical document.

Su historia data desde el 135 d.C. Cuando fue construido a petición del emperador Adriano, que solicitó un mausoleo para él y su familia pero con dimensiones mayores, razón por la cual, anteriormente era conocido como Mausoleo di Adriano.

Su actual nombre lo recibió en el año 590, durante la epidemia de Peste en Roma, debido a que el Papa Gregorio I tuvo una visión del Arcangel Miguel sobre el mausoleo que le indicaba el fin de la epidemia. 

Sin duda, un lugar con muchísima historia que conocer. Podrás explorar su fortaleza, y disfrutar de su belleza a pesar de los años y sobre todo de las magníficas vistas de Roma desde sus antiguas murallas.

Hyannis is home to our main island ferry terminal. Nantucket has a special place in our heart – we’ve been providing seasonal ferry service since 1973 and year-round service since December 1995. With multiple daily departures, and upwards of nine in the summer, we’ve got you covered no matter what your schedule to Nantucket is.  When you get to the island, cruising into Nantucket Harbor, you will pass Brant Point Lighthouse, completed in 1759.

Itinerary
Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area
The Columbia River Gorge takes the crown of the most magnificent views in America, and boy does it deserve it! At the western tip, Crown Point offers a jaw-dropping vantage point of the Columbia River as it slices through the Cascade mountains. Prepare to be dazzled by a cascade of waterfalls, including big names like Multnomah, Bridal Veil and Latourell falls, pouring down basalt cliffs lining the Historic Columbia River Highway. Hold tight, 'cause the scenery only gets more epic as you head east.

Multnomah Falls
Get ready to be swept away by the magic of Multnomah Falls! This 620-foot stunner is fed by underground streams from Larch Mountain, cascading into two breathtaking sections. The upper falls are a jaw-dropping 542 feet, and the lower section drops 69 feet, creating a babbling creek that flows into the majestic Columbia River. Hold onto your hats, folks, because you're looking at the second highest year-round waterfall in the US and the highest in all of Oregon! It's no wonder that this natural gem attracts over 2.5 million visitors each year from every corner of the globe.

And that's not all! At the base of the falls sits the Historic Multnomah Falls Lodge, a one-stop-shop for all your waterfall needs. You can chow down at the restaurant, grab a keepsake at the gift shop, or quench your thirst with a tasty snack or espresso at the bar. Plus, there's an interpretative center to help you understand the fascinating history of the area. Get ready to be mesmerized!

Rowena Crest Viewpoint
Ready for a ride of a lifetime? Buckle up and watch the world transform before your very eyes as we drive east towards the epic Rowena Crest viewpoint. This massive basalt beauty, once known as Memaloose Castle, boasts a jaw-dropping landscape and a road that's a work of art in itself. Back in 1915, the Historic Columbia River Highway was crafted with horse-shoe curves and switchbacks, perfect for low-horsepower vehicles to navigate the 700-foot climb to the top. So, sit back and take in the stunning surroundings as we chug along this horseshoe-shaped road, leading to the top. Behold the breathtaking view from Rowena Crest, showcasing an awe-inspiring landscape carved out by the Missoula Floods during the ice age. Little wonder why this is one of the most photographed spots in Oregon!

Hood River
Get ready to chow down on some serious farm-to-table eats in the charming downtown of Hood River! With an hour to spare for lunch, you can enjoy some of the freshest cuisine sourced locally, all while overlooking the majestic Columbia River. This outdoor haven is a windsurfing paradise, with plenty of hiking, skiing, and biking to keep you on your toes. And don't forget to keep an eye out for those daring windsurfers as they glide across the fourth largest river in North America!

Located just an hour east of Portland, Hood River is a scenic gem nestled in the Columbia River Gorge. It's sandwiched between two potentially active volcanoes, Mt. Adams to the north and Mt. Hood to the south. This former timber town has transformed into an outdoor recreation hub, with amazing activities like white-water kayaking, rock climbing, paragliding, and skiing to get your adrenaline pumping. And when lunchtime rolls around, downtown Hood River has got you covered with a plethora of restaurant and craft brewery options like Boda's Kitchen and Double Mountain Brewery, plus a chance to browse through local boutiques and wine tasting rooms. After lunch, we'll venture into the Hood River Valley, where you'll be dazzled by the natural beauty and thousands of acres of fruit orchards. Soak up the stunning views of the mountains as you learn about the history of the area's agriculture and timber industry.

Timberline Lodge
The majestic Timberline Lodge, perched on the southern side of Mt. Hood, rang in its 75th birthday in 2012. Originally, a brainchild of the Works Project Administration (WPA) art project, the lodge boasts some of the finest examples of artistry from that era, with gorgeous woodwork, ironwork, and paintings. The mountain's natural contours were mirrored in the lodge's design, using stone and wood sourced from the nearby forest. In 1977, it was declared a National Historic Landmark. Nowadays, more than two million visitors flock to Timberline Lodge each year to hit the slopes, hike, or just bask in the glory of the mountain with a glass of Oregon's finest wine.

Mt Hood
The runner-up of the world's most scaled mountains, Mt. Hood, reigns supreme with its 11 frosty glaciers and the sole year-long ski resort in North America. Timberline Lodge, a stunning structure erected during the 1930s WPA program, is now the perfect place to ski, hike, or unwind by the crackling fire, all while basking in the awe-inspiring sight of the towering mountain.

But that's not all! The area around Mt. Hood is a treasure trove of farms, with the Hood River County Fruit Loop being the crown jewel. It's a sprawling expanse of orchards, vineyards, and fields of fragrant lavender and wildflowers.

Ahí conocerás el barranco de Guayadeque, uno de los barrancos más grandes del archipiélago, y que destaca por sus valiosos restos arqueológicos prehispánicos hallados en la zona.

The adventure begins with a stop at the Skógafoss waterfall, where you can admire its powerful drop and, if you're lucky, see a rainbow in its mist. 

We will continue to the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon, where you will enjoy a boat ride among the floating icebergs, allowing you to get close to these magnificent ice formations. 

We will visit the Diamond Beach, where fragments of icebergs shine like gems on the black sand, creating a spectacular and unique view. 

Next, we will make a stop in the picturesque village of Vík and Mýrdal, known for its beautiful black sand beaches and its charming church on the hill. 

Here you can explore and enjoy the views before heading to Freysnes for dinner (not included), where you can taste the local cuisine in a lovely setting. 

The tour also includes a visit to the Seljalandsfoss waterfall, famous for its path that allows you to walk behind the curtain of water, offering a unique and exciting perspective. 

Along the way, weather permitting, you will have the opportunity to see some of Iceland's most well-known volcanoes, such as Hekla, Eyjafjallajökull, the Westman Islands, Katla, and Öræfajökull. 

You will also pass by several impressive glaciers, including Langjökull, Mýrdalsjökull, Vatnajökull, and their glacial tongues. 

The waterfalls you will find along the way, besides Skógafoss and Seljalandsfoss, include Systrafoss and Foss á Síðu, among others. The vast sandy plains of Skógasandur, Sólheimasandur, Mýrdalssandur, Skeiðarársandur, and Breiðamerkursandur offer desolate and fascinating landscapes. 

Additionally, you will enjoy spectacular views of the coastline at various points, including the beaches of Vík and the Diamond Beach, as well as views toward the southern coast. Throughout the tour, you will be able to admire the fertile farmland and the moss-covered lava fields that characterize the Icelandic landscape.","We will meet at the BSI bus terminal in Reykjavik located at ""Vatnsmýrarvegur, Reykjavík 101, IS,"" ready to start our tour. \n\nThe adventure begins with a stop at the Skógafoss waterfall, where you can admire its powerful drop and, if you're lucky, see a rainbow in its mist. \n\nWe will continue to the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon, where you will enjoy a boat ride among the floating icebergs, allowing you to get close to these magnificent ice formations. \n\nWe will visit the Diamond Beach, where fragments of icebergs shine like gems on the black sand, creating a spectacular and unique view. \n\nNext, we will make a stop in the picturesque village of Vík and Mýrdal, known for its beautiful black sand beaches and its charming church on the hill. \n\nHere you can explore and enjoy the views before heading to Freysnes for dinner (not included), where you can taste the local cuisine in a lovely setting. \n\nThe tour also includes a visit to the Seljalandsfoss waterfall, famous for its path that allows you to walk behind the curtain of water, offering a unique and exciting perspective. \n\nAlong the way, weather permitting, you will have the opportunity to see some of Iceland's most well-known volcanoes, such as Hekla, Eyjafjallajökull, the Westman Islands, Katla, and Öræfajökull. \n\nYou will also pass by several impressive glaciers, including Langjökull, Mýrdalsjökull, Vatnajökull, and their glacial tongues. \n\nThe waterfalls you will find along the way, besides Skógafoss and Seljalandsfoss, include Systrafoss and Foss á Síðu, among others.

mec_id,83672,longDesc,"¿Listo para la aventura? Para iniciar esta excursión pasaremos por ti a tu hotel. Los autobuses salen temprano en la mañana desde El Calafate y cuentan con audio guía bilingüe. 

Una vez iniciado el viaje, nos dirigiremos al Parque Nacional de los Glaciares, lugar donde se encuentra el Glaciar Perito Moreno, una de las más asombrosas maravillas naturales de Argentina. 

Al llegar al Parque Nacional, se visitarán las pasarelas, donde te recibirá un guía que te orientará sobre el recorrido en los balcones y te asignará un horario de encuentro para el traslado hacia el Puerto Bajo Las Sombras. 

Una vez se finalice esta etapa del recorrido de aproximadamente 1 hora, el mismo autobús te llevará a dicho puerto, en donde te subirás a una de las embarcaciones. 

Navegarás durante 20 minutos por el Brazo Rico del Lago Argentino y frente a la pared sur del Glaciar Perito Moreno, hacia el otro lado del lago. 

Allí serás recibido por guías (habilitados por el Parque Nacional Los Glaciares y la Asociación de Guías de Montaña), quienes dividirán al grupo en subgrupos por idioma inglés y castellano y los acompañarán durante todo el recorrido. 

El tiempo total de la caminata es de 3 horas, de las cuales la mitad, aproximadamente, está dedicada a caminar sobre el hielo del glaciar con crampones y casco. 

En el recorrido de hielo te encontrarás con una gran cantidad de  bajadas y subidas, y podrás apreciar grietas, lagunas, arroyos, sumideros y más. ¡Todo un espectáculo de la naturaleza! 

Luego de pasar esa zona, el resto de la caminata se realiza en el bosque, sobre terreno pedregoso.

Durante el recorrido, tendrás un tiempo libre para poder descansar un poco, comer tus snacks y beber un poco de agua para recuperar fuerzas y continuar. 

Dependiendo del horario que te hayan asignado, será el tiempo que puedas dedicar en las pasarelas o en refugio dentro del área del minitrekking.

Una vez finalizado el Minitrekking, se navega de regreso hasta el Puerto Bajo Las Sombras para tomar el bus de regreso a El Calafate, (70km).

El Dubai Frame es una impresionante adición al paisaje arquitectónico de la ciudad. Con dos torres de 150 metros de altura conectadas por un puente de 100 metros cuadrados, se ha convertido en un símbolo icónico de Dubái. 

En su interior, hay un museo y galería que narran la evolución de Dubái, desde sus humildes inicios como pueblo pesquero, hasta la metrópolis moderna que es hoy. Mediante tecnología avanzada y fotografías, podrás sumergirse en la fascinante historia de la ciudad.

Al terminar el recorrido por el museo, un ascensor te llevará al puente donde disfrutarás de dos vistas increíbles: por un lado, el Dubái antiguo y por el otro, el Dubái moderno, ofreciendo un contraste único entre pasado y futuro.

A continuación, visitarás el Burj Al Arab, uno de los íconos más emblemáticos de Dubái. Disfrutarás de un recorrido exclusivo y degustarás la auténtica cocina emiratí en un buffet con más de 60 sabores locales, 3 estaciones en vivo y una increíble barra de mariscos frescos.

Para completar la experiencia, subirás a The View, una plataforma de observación en el piso 52 de la Palm Tower. Desde 240 metros de altura, podrás admirar una vista panorámica de 360 grados que abarca Palm Jumeirah, el horizonte de Dubái y el Golfo Pérsico. Además, el recorrido incluye una visita al museo que narra el origen de Palm Jumeirah.

The View cuenta con áreas abiertas y cerradas, una sala VIP, una cafetería y una tienda de recuerdos, para que te lleves un poco de Dubái contigo al final de esta inolvidable experiencia.","Para este increíble día, pasaremos por ti a tu hotel en Dubái y, una vez juntos, ¡iniciaremos la aventura!  \n\nEl Dubai Frame es una impresionante adición al paisaje arquitectónico de la ciudad.

Posteriormente, te llevaremos al Dubai Mall para subir en el ascensor más rápido del mundo y admirar vistas panorámicas desde el nivel 124 del Burj Khalifa.  

Después, te relajarás con un almuerzo de 3 platos en el Burj Club, en el tercer piso, para finalmente, aprovechar una hora para explorar las tiendas del famoso Dubái Mall.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start your day trip from Barcelona in a comfortable luxury micro-bus to the mountain of Montserrat which rises majestically to 4,051 feet (1,236 meter). The rocks of Montserrat were formed by natural cement of sand during the centuries. The wind and rain shaped the mountain with strange and varied forms. The popular imagination has seen human or animal shape in some of these peaks, giving those names and inventing legends to explain their fantastic origins. This trip to Montserrat will give you the opportunity to enjoy the wonderful and breath taking views of the Montserrat Mountain, one of nature&rsquo;s special creations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will enjoy an early visit to the Royal Basilica of Montserrat before it gets crowded. This Sanctuary holds the famous 12th century Romanesque carving of Verge Moreneta (the Black Madonna). You will be able to see this famous statue of the Black Madonna from a distance. The Benedict sanctuary of Montserrat has been founded in 1025 and provides a mystical backdrop for the Virgin of Montserrat, the patron saint of Catalonia who is enshrined in the monastery's Royal Basilica. The little monastery soon began to receive pilgrims and visitors who contributed to the spread of stories of miracles and wonders performed by the Virgin. Today, Montserrat has been modernized to continue attending to the needs to pilgrims, one thousand years after it was originally founded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be given some free time to visit the audiovisual exhibition about the history and creation of Montserrat. And taste typical liquors of Montserrat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the visit we will take you to the Montserrat hidden treasure, the ancient monastery of Santa Cecilia de Montserrat, located in a privileged and peaceful place on a natural terrace that offers extraordinary views of the emblematic cliffs of Montserrat , the valleys and also the Pyrenees on clear days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will enjoy an audio- guided visit of the church that is one of the most outstanding examples of Romanesque architecture in the region. The nobility of the church has been conserved over the centuries. This is a quality that the well-known Irish painter SEAN SCULLY ably reflects in his artistic intervention in the interior, where he has created an exceptional ensemble of painting and stained glass. His work makes Santa Cecilia one of the most outstanding sites in the world for its magnificent fusion of Christianity and avant-garde art. This is a unique in which to appreciate and feel history, art and spirituality in close contact with the natural beauty of Montserrat itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the visit you will continue your unforgettable experience enjoying a delicious brunch paired with wines on the porch or beautiful courtyard inside the enclosure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;After the brunch we will return to Barcelona.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Park G&uuml;ell Tour</strong></p>
<p>Don't miss the Park G&uuml;ell: it will really surprise you! You will not find any park like this one in the world! This architectural marvel, created in the middle of nature by Antoni Gaud&iacute;, was commissioned by Count G&uuml;ell, who wanted him to design an elegant estate with family homes. Today it is a public park and it belongs to the city's heritage. It has been declared UNESCO&rsquo;s World heritage site and is just another marvel that awaits you on your visit to Barcelona.</p>
<p>When you go to Park G&uuml;ell, you should enter by the big staircase dominated by the dragon decorated with mosaic of ceramic tiles, the Catalan style known as &ldquo;trencad&iacute;s&rdquo;. This dragon is one of the most characteristic images of Barcelona. Originally written Park G&uuml;ell (using the English spelling), the park is arranged around a large central square bordered by a snaking, &ldquo;trencad&iacute;s&rdquo;-covered bench. Below the square, the roof is supported by 86 Doric columns, like trees, with paths between them, and viaducts on sloping columns: Gaud&iacute;'s work, like no other, unites nature and architecture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tour Sagrada Familia</strong></p>
<p>We will take you know one of the Antoni Gaudi&rsquo;s treasures. The famous architect Antoni Gaud&iacute;, one of the greatest innovators of his time worked and lived Barcelona has left behind numerous treasures for the discerning tourist to discover in Barcelona.</p>
<p>The Sagrada Familia is one of the most visited buildings in the world. We will visit the astonishing interior of this church, where vaults reach seventy meters. Antoni Gaud&iacute; designed a Latin cross plan with five aisles, extremely rich in ornamentation and symbolism. We will also visit the Sagrada Familia museum, where you will see drawings, plaster models and pictures about the history and development of this basilica from its early beginnings to the present day. The museum will also give valuable information about Antoni Gaudi&acute;s life and career.</p>
