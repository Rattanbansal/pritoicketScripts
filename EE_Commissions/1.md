Matrix

1. Products which are lying with custom pricing enabled and distributor_commission_gap = we are going to update distributor commission as per sheet with distributor toggle enabled and rest all amount will go to museum

2. Products which are lying with cutom pricing but there distributor togle not enabled : that we are going to set as enabled and also for the resale fee we are also going to enable percentage button

3. Product with custom pricing having zero sum calculation mismatch: that we are going to update with distributors and museum commission rest will set as 0

4. product where we have not the distributor and museum_commission percentage not equal to sale price that we are going to update in same way as mentioned above


5. On sub catalog level we have 3 distributors for them we have not any sub catalog set so for that we need to check what more we can do for them.

6. On sub catalog we are going to update all commission in same way and also if any tps entries are missing that also we are going to insert with same commission allocation.

In reseller matrix we have the same steps but missing entries we will add only on default level.
