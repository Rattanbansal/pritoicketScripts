Steps to Archive RDS Database

1. Currently in the Visitor_tickets we have around 500 Gb data
2. So we need to delete all records where we have the last_modified < '2024-07-01 00:00:01' if any order having few dates less then mentioned date and some records with more than mentioned date then we will skip that order id
3. Same we need to do this for the other table like hotel_ticket_overview and prepaid_tickets as well 
4. Once above table completed we can start with archiving another tables.
5. so on basis of each particular data we need to run this delete commands.
